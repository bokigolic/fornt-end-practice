# Expanding Cards Project

## Introduction:
The Expanding Cards Project is a simple web page that displays a set of images with titles. The project allows users to interact with the images by clicking on them, which will expand the selected image to cover the entire screen. The project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Deployment:
The project is currently deployed on Netlify, and it can be accessed through the following link: [Expanding Cards](https://expandingcardsqw.netlify.app/).

## Usage:
To use this project, simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. Once the page is loaded, click on any of the images to see the expanding functionality in action.

## Files:
The project consists of three main files:

- index.html: This is the main HTML file that displays the webpage.
- style.css: This is the CSS file that styles the webpage.
- script.js: This is the JavaScript file that handles the expanding functionality.

## Functionality:
The expanding functionality of the project is achieved using JavaScript. When a user clicks on an image, the active class is added to the selected div element. This class triggers a CSS rule that changes the size and position of the image, making it expand and cover the entire screen. To ensure that only one image is expanded at a time, the removeActiveClasses() function is used to remove the active class from all div elements before adding it to the selected div element.
