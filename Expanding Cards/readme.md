# Expanding Cards Project

This project is a simple webpage that displays a set of images with a title, where each image expands and covers the whole screen when clicked. It was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Usage
To use this project, simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

When the page loads, you will see a set of images with a title. Clicking on any of these images will cause it to expand and cover the entire screen.

## Files
- index.html: The main HTML file that displays the webpage.
- style.css: The CSS file that styles the webpage.
- script.js: The JavaScript file that handles the expanding functionality.

## How it works
The expanding functionality is achieved using JavaScript. When a user clicks on an image, the active class is added to the selected div element, which has a CSS rule that changes the size and position of the image to cover the entire screen. The removeActiveClasses() function is used to remove the active class from all div elements before adding it to the selected div element.
