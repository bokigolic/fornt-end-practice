# Expanding Cards Project
The Expanding Cards Project is a simple webpage that showcases a set of images with titles. When an image is clicked, it expands and covers the entire screen, creating a more immersive experience. 

- The project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Deployment
The project is deployed on Netlify and can be accessed using the following link: [Expanding Cards](https://expandingcardsqw.netlify.app/)

## Usage
To use this project, simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. Once the page is loaded, click on any of the images to see the expanding functionality in action.

## Files
- index.html: The main HTML file that displays the webpage.
- style.css: The CSS file that styles the webpage.
- script.js: The JavaScript file that handles the expanding functionality.
- 
## How it works
The expanding functionality is achieved using JavaScript. When an image is clicked, the active class is added to the selected div element. This class triggers a CSS rule that changes the size and position of the image, making it expand and cover the entire screen. To ensure that only one image is expanded at a time, the removeActiveClasses() function is used to remove the active class from all div elements before adding it to the selected div element.

## Credits
