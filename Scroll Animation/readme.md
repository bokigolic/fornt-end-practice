# Scroll Animation

## Description
This is a simple web project that showcases a scroll animation effect using JavaScript. The animation effect is triggered when the user scrolls down the page and reveals a series of images

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Getting Started
To run this project, you will need a web browser that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can simply open the 'index.html' file in your browser, and the animation will start automatically.

## Usage
To add more images to the project, simply add the image file to the 'img' folder and update the HTML code accordingly. The image files should be named in numerical order (e.g., '1.jpeg', '2.jpeg', '3.jpeg', etc.) to maintain the correct order in the animation.

The JavaScript code in 'script.js' controls the animation effect by adding and removing the 'show' class to each image box. The 'checkBoxes' function is called on page load and whenever the user scrolls down the page, which checks if each image box is in view and adds the 'show' class if it is.
