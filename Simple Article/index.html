      <h1>Amazing article about Washington DC</h1>
      <small>The capital of the US </small>
      <p>The capital of the United States has a lot to offer visitors, not least its wallet-friendliness: most of its
        many world-class museums, monuments and galleries are free. Whether you’ve seen Washington DC on the news, in
        The West Wing or at the movies, it’s always thrilling to view the likes of the White House, the Capitol Building
        and the Washington Monument up close for yourself, or stand on the National Mall where Martin Luther King dared
        to dream. The city is relatively compact and downtown is built on a grid system, so finding your way from A to B
        is straightforward. Throw in world-class restaurants and friendly neighbourhood bars and you’ll see why a few
        days here pass quickly. And if you don’t drive, but want a two-spot holiday, it’s easy to combine Washington
        with cities such as New York and Philadelphia, which are just a few hours away by train.</p>

      <h3>What to do</h3>
      <p>
        The Smithsonian Institution has 19 free-to-enter museums and the National Zoo under its umbrella, including the
        National Portrait Gallery, National Air and Space Museums (exhibits there include the Wright Brothers’ plane
        Kitty
        Hawk and Spirit of St Louis, the first plane to cross the Atlantic nonstop) and National Museum of American
        History, where you can see the top hat worn by Abraham Lincoln the night he was assassinated and Judy Garland’s
        ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz.

        You need to book a timed-entry ticket in advance for some, such as the National Museum of African American
        History
        and Culture. You can take a guided visit around the Capitol, where US Congress sits, by booking online.
        Elsewhere
        on Capitol Hill* you can tour the Library of Congress and Supreme Court. Make time to stroll around the
        colonial-era neighbourhood of Georgetown* and watch a concert at the Kennedy Center.
      </p>
      <h3>Where to stay</h3>
      <p>
        The small centre of Washington DC is where you’ll find the majority of the city’s hotels, scattered about in
        both
        residential and business neighbourhoods. From a tourism perspective, anything close to the National Mall — home
        to
        the majority of Smithsonian museums, as well as the Capitol Building and national monuments — is a plus.

        As you’d expect of the capital, DC has the full spectrum of properties from upmarket hotels close to the
        political
        seat of power, such as the Willard*, the Hay-Adams* and the Jefferson*, to more budget-oriented European imports
        such as Yotel*, CitizenM* and Generator*.

        For a more residential vibe with bars and restaurants to hand, try areas slightly further out such as Dupont
        Circle and Foggy Bottom. And if you really want to save money consider a chain hotel in the suburbs, somewhere
        like Chevy Chase or Bethesda (where Marriott has its HQ) in Maryland, or Rosslyn in Arlington or Alexandria in
        Virginia. They’re only a 20-minute hop downtown on the Metro, and there are plenty of places to eat on your
        doorstep.
